# Investigating π
Sarvesh Venkittu's Duke University MATH260 Final Project

## Description
Approximating the mathematical constant π has been an area of interest in mathematics for centuries. Various methods, both deterministic and probabilistic, have been developed to estimate π with increasing accuracy. Two well-known probabilistic methods are Buffon’s Needle and the Monte Carlo Unit Circle method. This project focuses on comparing these two approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and computational complexity.

## Background - Key Vocabulary
- Buffon’s Needle: A probability-based method for estimating π by dropping a needle onto a plane with parallel lines and analyzing the probability of the needle crossing a line.
- Monte Carlo Simulation: A computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to estimate numerical results, commonly applied to approximate π. 
- Unit Circle Method: A Monte Carlo technique where points are randomly placed in a square, and the proportion falling inside an inscribed quarter-circle is used to estimate π.
- Probabilistic Methods: Techniques that use randomness and statistical principles to estimate numerical values.
- Deterministic Methods: Methods that use fixed, non-random algorithms to compute values with exact precision.
